<h1> Customized Portio Hugo</h1>

üñºÔ∏è This is a slightly tweaked version of the [Portio](https://github.com/StaticMania/portio-hugo) Hugo theme by StaticMania.

I've changed the layout, navigation bar, and more. These are specific changes for my [website](www.anthonydellavecchia.com), so I recommend that you fork the official repo from StaticMania (linked above).

---

Portio is a simple, minimal and responsive Portfolio Hugo Theme. Portio is well organized, well-formatted and named accordingly so it‚Äôs easy to change any and all of the design. Portio is built with Bootstrap 4. You can customize it very easy to fit your needs.
